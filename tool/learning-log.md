I learned that in Aframe you can create many different 3d models. I didnt understand the purpose of A frame but after reading some websites i was able to father my understanding of A frame. I was looking into the A frame website and saw many different codes i never seen before but when i started to tinker with it i was able to see a 3d plate form of the objects i added. I also saw a change in the size and color of the object. I felt like there is a deeper context behidn my curiousity of A frame.
