# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Describe why i chose business as my choices
* Tell a business joke (maybe)
* ask the audience if they know any information about business.

## Product
* https://leolin2351.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/
* explain the time and how i created this

## Process
* explain the context 
* explain the softwares
* explain the hardwares
* show the timeline
* show the a-frame model
  

## Conclusion
* ONe takeaway i will exprience from this is how to manage stress with this plan because i always get scared when presenting so i will try to be confident and not be scared so i can get some feedback and improvemnt before the real presentation
* Another takeaway is dont be scared they wouldnt bite because i always think my classmate woild laugh at me if i mess up but i got to face being laugh at.
* Third takeaway is be myself because i always try to become someone else who present earlier than me because they would beocm my inspration when presenting but i need to be myself.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
