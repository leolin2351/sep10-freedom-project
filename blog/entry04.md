# Entry 4:LEARNING A TOOL(AFRAME)
##### 3/2/24
<h2>What tools I chose:</h2>
<p> In this blog we had to research on some computer sciences tools. We had to research many different types of tool in computer sciences. I had many choices that I wanted to learn more about but chose A Frame. Aframe is a digital data transmission unit in computer networking and telecommunications. Its used to manage program execution and maintain data during method calls. In other telecommunications systems, a frame is a repeating structure supporting time-division multiplexing. I found this tool to be very interesting and helps me explore my curiosity of this tool.</p>
<h2>Tinkering with A Frame:</h2>
When I was tinkering with a frame I learned a lot in videos and the A frame website. I learned that you can create 3D shapes and backgrounds with Frame. I was able to use this starting code and play around with it to deepen my understanding of A Frame.

```
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-2 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="brown"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1" color="#blue"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="0.8 0.75 -3" radius="1" height="2" color="#red"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#green"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="black"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
```
<p> These codes helped me create a scene with 3d blocks, a plane, and a sky. I was tinkering around with this code by adjusting the colors and the shapes. I changed the sky to black because I wanted it to be night time. I kept the plane green because I wanted the grass to be lighter than dark green. I adjusted the position of each shape and changed the color of it. This was just a sample of what a frame can do.</p>
<h2> The Source i used:</h2>
<p>The source i used to deeper understand Aframe was https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho74yKJtdyI. The youtube video explains A Frame and how i major importance of this computer sciences tool. It testes each html and explains what all the codes do. I was able to fully understand a bit more about Aframe and the positive when using A Frame. It is always you to move around and see the result of what you got when using some html codes. I watched this video and tinkered each step of what the person is saying. When I didn't understand what the person was talking about, I went on the website of A Frame and readed what each of the code would change or make your scene different. These 2 sources I used were like a side kick because one was able to explain it by testing and if I didn't understand I could go to the website and see what the person was trying to tell me.</p>
<h2>Skills I experienced:</h2>
<p>One skill I experienced was <b>learning on my own</b> l because I had to research everything on A Frame by myself. I couldn't communicate with my friends because they had different passion for computer science tools. For example i wanted to start my own scene so i googled up A Frame basic scene which gave me this website
https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/. I was able to copy and paste the code and went on CS50.dev and tinkered around with it.</p>
<p>The second skill I experienced was <b>creativity</b>. I had to be creative with what I learned on A Frame so I went on JSbin and created a sample of what I learned without looking back at any videos or the website. I was surprised that I was able to understand how to use the commands I learned and made a house by stacking a triangular prism on top of a box. I add a green plane and a blue sky to make it more like a peaceful home.</p>
