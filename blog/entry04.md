# Entry 4:LEARNING A TOOL(AFRAME)
##### 3/2/24
<h2>What tools I chose:</h2>
<p> In this blog we had to research on some computer sciences tools. We had to research many different types of tool in computer sciences. I had many choices that i wnateed to learn more about but choose Aframe. Aframe is a digital data transmission unit in computer networking and telecommunications. Its used to manage program execution and maintain data during method calls. In other telecommunications systems, a frame is a repeating structure supporting time-division multiplexing. I found this tool to be very interesting and helps me explore my curiosuity of this tool.</p>
<h2>Tinkering with Aframe:</h2>
When i was tinkering with aframe i learned alot in videos and the A frame website. I learned that you can create 3d shapes and background with Aframe. I was able to use this starting codes and play around with it to deeper my understanding of Aframe.

```
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-2 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="brown"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1" color="#blue"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="0.8 0.75 -3" radius="1" height="2" color="#red"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#green"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="black"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
```
<p> these code helped me create a scene with 3d blocks, a plane, and a sky. I was tinkering around these code by adjusing the colors and the shapes. I change the sky to black because i wanted it to be night timee. I kept the plane green because i wanted the grass to be lighter than dark green. I adjusted the position of each shape and changed the color of it. This was just the sample of what aframe can do.</p>
<h2> The Source i used:</h2>
<p>The source i used to deeper understand Aframe was https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho74yKJtdyI. The youtube video explains Aframe and how do i major importance of this computer sciences tool. It testes each html and explains what all the codes do. I was able to fully understand abit more about Aframe and the positve when using Aframe. It always you to move around and see the result of what you got when using some html codes. I watched this video and tinkered each step of what the person is saying. When i didnt understand what the person was talking about i went on the website of Aframe and readed what each of the code would change or make your scene different. These 2 sources i used was like side kick because one was able to explain it by testing and if i didnt understand i could go to the website and see what the person was trying to tell me.</p>
<h2>Skills I experienced</h2>
<p>One skill i expericenced was <b>learning on my own</b> l because i had to research everything on Aframe by myself. I couldnt communicate with my friends because they had different passion in computer science tools. For example i wanted to start my own scene so i googled up Aframe basic scene which gave me this website
https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/. I was able to copy and paste the code and went on CS50.dev and tinkered around with it.</p>
<p>The second skill i experinced was <b>creativity</b> i had to be creative of what i learned on Aframe so i went on jsbin and created a sample of what i learned without looking back at any videos or the webiste. I was suprised that i was able to that i understand how to use the commands i learned and made a house by stacking a tringular prism oon top of a box. I add a green plane and a blue sky to make it more like a peaceful home.</p>p
