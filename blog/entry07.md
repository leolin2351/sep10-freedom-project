# Entry 7
<h2>Context:</h2>
<p> For this blog, i was required to preseny and give an elevator pitch of how i would present my project. When presenting to the class i had experienced many diffculty likes speaking to much and eye contact because i talked alot and didnt give alot of eye contact. I wasnt ready to present early which got me scared and alot of people were looking at me. I forgot alot of my <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aO_zO-YaDIbki2SZRt7GLt166KQCT3Sp9PM1_0h6wWg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p">slide</a> because i tried to be more confident and not look at the board but more force on the classmate. But i failed because i didnt feel confident with my ability to talk withoiut look at the board. But when i went down alot of my friend said i did good because i went up pretty early. But during the public speaking i did very bad on it, my main problem with my public speaking was understanding what i should say because i thought i was suppose to present like what i did on my slides but i was wrong. Some of the higher grade level people liked my presentantion and told me to present like this to the judge but i didnt feel confident because there was alot of people looking at me. This led me to present poorly because i got pressured very hard which caused me to get a low grade from the judges. One of my friend suggested me to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySEXdq9evnw">how to present better</a>. This was something i learn after the expo.</p>
<h2>EDP:</h2>
I am on the 6th stage of EDP which is test and evaluate. What this mean is that i am testing and also evaluating by my clasmate and teacher for future improvement. Throughout my presentation and elevator pitch i wasnt shining compared to my friends and with these feedback i can do better. Now i am moving to step 7 which is improve and on stage 8 is communicate the result. After these feedback i was able to start growing on these for future presentation next year.
<h2>Skill</h2>
<p> communcation</p>
<ul>
 <li>when i was giving my presentation i was very nervous and couldnt communicate with others. Like during the expo i got very nervous because my friends and judges were all behidn me which scared me which caused me to perform poorly. Many higher grader said mines was very good and was the best they saw but the judeges couldnt see it because i was very nervous and wasnt confident. SO this skill is something i learned but also need to be improved on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organization</p>
<ul>
  <li>When i made my presentation i needed to make a draft of my evevlator pitch. But i forced on organizing my slides and webiste i forgot to finish my draft which caused me to perform poorly during the expo but i was still able to impress some other people because they liked how my website looked and how it was organized.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>Some takeaway i learned from this expreince was dont lose your teacher trust because i used some code from my friends but i told the truth and now i didnt do good on my website and felt like all my work wouldnt be good in the future but another takeaway i learned was improve communcation becuse alot of juddges told me that i wasnt cconfident and they couldnt give me a good score.</p>
