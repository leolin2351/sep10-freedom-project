# Entry 7
<h2>Context:</h2>
<p> For this blog, I was required to present and give an elevator pitch of how I would present my project. When presenting to the class I had experienced many difficulties like speaking too much and eye contact because I talked alot and didnt give alot of eye contact. I wasn't ready to present early which got me scared and a lot of people were looking at me. I forgot alot of my <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aO_zO-YaDIbki2SZRt7GLt166KQCT3Sp9PM1_0h6wWg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p">slide</a> because i tried to be more confident and not look at the board but more force on the classmate. But I failed because I didn't feel confident with my ability to talk without looking at the board. But when i went down alot of my friend said i did good because i went up pretty early. But during the public speaking i did very bad on it, my main problem with my public speaking was understanding what i should say because i thought i was suppose to present like what i did on my slides but i was wrong. Some of the higher grade people liked my presentation and told me to present like this to the judge but i didnt feel confident because there were a lot of people looking at me. This led me to present poorly because i got pressured very hard which caused me to get a low grade from the judges. One of my friend suggested me to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySEXdq9evnw">how to present better</a>. This was something i learn after the expo.</p>
<h2>EDP:</h2>
I am on the 6th stage of EDP which is test and evaluate. What this means is that I am tested and also evaluated by my classmates and teacher for future improvement. Throughout my presentation and elevator pitch I was shining compared to my friends and with this feedback I can do better. Now i am moving to step 7 which is improve and on stage 8 is communicate the result. After these feedback i was able to start growing on these for future presentation next year.
<h2>Skill</h2>
<p> communication</p>
<ul>
 <li>when i was giving my presentation i was very nervous and couldn't communicate with others. Like during the expo i got very nervous because my friends and judges were all behind me which scared me which caused me to perform poorly. Many higher graders said mine was very good and was the best they saw but the judges couldn't see it because I was very nervous and wasn't confident. SO this skill is something i learned but also need to be improved on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organization</p>
<ul>
  <li>When I made my presentation I needed to make a draft of my elevator pitch. But I was forced to organize my slides and website. I forgot to finish my draft which caused me to perform poorly during the expo but I was still able to impress some other people because they liked how my website looked and how it was organized.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>Some takeaway i learned from this experience was dont lose your teacher trust because i used some code from my friends but i told the truth and now i didnt do good on my website and felt like all my work wouldn't be good in the future but another takeaway i learned was improve communication because a lot of judges told me that I wasn't confident and they couldn't give me a good score.</p>
