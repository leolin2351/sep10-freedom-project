<h1><b>CONTEXT:</b></h1>
<p>For blog 3 i had to brainstorm new techonlogical ideas for my topic with the information i gathered on already existed techonlogy. Since manny of these techonlogy were researched about by pevious SEP students i was able to gather information from them about business techonlogy. I wanted to be more unique and more different with my techonlogy so i did some deep researches about old techonlogy and how they were used today. I was able to see the grow of a unknown techonlogy and how they were use in our present day. Many of these techology i researched was common but wasnt mainly use. For my idea i was brainstorming things that would be cheap to make and work better than humans. This idea took my many days to plan out because AI and robots are expensive to make and would be hard to program. I had to do deeper research about how people were able to control Ais like chat gpt. I watched alot of youtube on how people control chatgpt like turning off memorys because with memorys turn on it would be easy for chatgt to store personal information. I used a website about  [economics](https://esmhana1319.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) and another one about [customer service](https://dildoran2195.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) as a inspiration because both customer service and economic connect to business. I was able to see how the economy has evolved over time which made many businesses grow in popularity and money. I was able to also see how the improvement of customer service was able to help businesses grow in sales and popularity. These 2 sources I used were able to connect to business because economy means money and business makes money which shows a connection on how money has changed over time which made business change inorder to make more money. And customer service connects to business because with a improvement in customer service, you would get alot of buyers which can increase the money growth.</p>

<h1><b>FUTURE OF BUSINESS:</b></h1>
<p>Throughout our modern day technology, many people try to improve our modern day technology. People's plans are to bring AI to business technology. Many future technologies are about to be taken over by AI because AIs are smarter and give advice to increase business wealth. We did a lot of researches into the future, and i was able to list a lot of future needs:</p>

<p>This technology is what we like to call the future because people have the ideas planned out but have to create it. Many of these future technologies are improvements or AI technology. These future technologies allow business owners to solve problems throughout their daily life like the problems that need to be figured out. These technologies would allow business owners to grow and add on to their business. It would also allow business owner to communicate with consumer and ask question for future improvements.</p>
<h1>SOURCES:</h1>
<p>The source I used was chatgpt because it's an AI that I can interact with and ask questions for future business needs and it can provide me with details on what the future needs. ChatGPT was able to give me a lot of ideas that I can write about like AI and improved technology. I used ChatGPTs ideas but also added on to its idea which was able to answer many questions on future technology in business. ChatGPT was a great source to me because I couldn't think of any future ideas but with chat gpt ideas I was able to resource more and add my own ideas. Another source i used was business.fiu.edu because it talks about the advantage when using AI generated. Business.fiu.edu is a credible as a source because FIU Business is among the 5% of elite business schools worldwide. Which means that FIU is a elite business school and shares important notes for people who wants to study business. This source was able to give me ideas of AI that would be needed for future business owners.</p>

<h1>EDP:</h1>
<p> I am in engineering design process 3 which is brainstorming. I have to brainstorm ideas on future improvement for business majors. I have to brainstorm ideas that can increase the profit of business. I brainstorm many different ideas like AI and technology like drones that can ship out products. I was able to brainstorm these designs because drones can be cheaper to make and can ship products in the sky. The idea of AI is basic because with the idea of AI it can be beneficial to business owners like an AI assistant that can tell you problems about the product or about the business and gives you advice in advance to solve these problems. This idea is good because the AI assistant would be much smarter and helpful with tasks that take very long to accomplish. But these 2 designs I brainstormed had negatives like the cost of building it and the problems it might create. For the AI assistant a problem would be it can take over jobs for many assistants and for drones would be the strength to carry products in the sky. Next stage in design process 4 is plan where i would plan out something that would be cheaper and works as well as normal people.</p>
<h1>SKILLS:</h1>

```
1.*how to use google*
```
<p> The skill that I developed throughout this research is how to use google because I needed to find a credible source for this project. I needed a credible source because it talks about real facts and shows no biases. Learning how to use google is very important for this project because I had to find sources that talk about future improvement and the current problems. Many people don't know how to use google and find credible sources which makes it hard to provide future technology for the future. I searched up future problems+AI+business which gave me many sources that answer my problems. The problem it was able to answer for me was if AI technology is really going to shift businesses. This problem was able to relate to the skill I learned because without the words I search up I would get many different biased points of view which would be hard to create future needs for. </p>

```
2.*Creativity*
```
<p>The second skill I was able to develop was creativity because I needed to be creative with the future technology. I had to be both creative and general because I needed to know the general technology for business inorder to find a creative version of it. A creative idea that I thought of was if computers can fit in your pocket. I was able to get this idea because many business majors use computers as a main source of notes and other things. But the negative thing about a computer is how big and heavy it was. This led to me being creative if i can invent a computer that fits in your pocket so it can save space in your backpack. This skill was important to me because I had to list future inventions which led me to think bigger and outside the boxes.</p>
