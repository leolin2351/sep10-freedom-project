<h1>SOURCES:</h1>
<p>The source I used was chatgpt because it's an AI that I can interact with and ask questions for future business needs and it can provide me with details on what the future needs. ChatGPT was able to give me a lot of ideas that I can write about like AI and improved technology. I used ChatGPTs ideas but also added on to its idea which was able to answer many questions on future technology in business. ChatGPT was a great source to me because I couldn't think of any future ideas but with chat gpt ideas I was able to resource more and add my own ideas.</p>
<h1>EDP</h1>
<p> The engineering design process that I would do is something related to AI because in business.fiu.edu it states how AI would be an advantage for business owners. I can design an AI that can be an assistant because with AI assistants it can handle chores, emails, and scheduling in order to increase productivity. With the AI idea I believe it would be great for business owners because the AI assistant can take calls and inform you of the problems and solutions to save your business and how to expand it.I would create a prototype AI that works as an assistant but would need future improvement like understanding human languages. I would the AI doing what a normal assistant would do like talk about problems and future solutions. The improvement I would make is making sure the AI would understand every human language and also obey the owner and cause chaos. I would give a presentation and allow people to see what this AI assistant can do and also record the positive and negative of an AI assistant.</p>
