<h1>SOURCES:</h1>
<p>The source I used was chatgpt because it's an AI that I can interact with and ask questions for future business needs and it can provide me with details on what the future needs. ChatGPT was able to give me a lot of ideas that I can write about like AI and improved technology. I used ChatGPTs ideas but also added on to its idea which was able to answer many questions on future technology in business. ChatGPT was a great source to me because I couldn't think of any future ideas but with chat gpt ideas I was able to resource more and add my own ideas. Another source i used was business.fiu.edu because it talks about the advantage when using AI generated. Business.fiu.edu is a crediable as a source because FIU Business is among the 5% of elite business schools worldwide. Which means that FIU is a elite business school and shares important notes for people who wants to study business. This source was able to give me ideas of AI that would be needed for future business owners.</p>

<h1>EDP:</h1>
<p> The engineering design process that I would do is something related to AI because in business.fiu.edu it states how AI would be an advantage for business owners. I can design an AI that can be an assistant because with AI assistants it can handle chores, emails, and scheduling in order to increase productivity. With the AI idea I believe it would be great for business owners because the AI assistant can take calls and inform you of the problems and solutions to save your business and how to expand it.I would create a prototype AI that works as an assistant but would need future improvement like understanding human languages. I would the AI doing what a normal assistant would do like talk about problems and future solutions. The improvement I would make is making sure the AI would understand every human language and also obey the owner and cause chaos. I would give a presentation and allow people to see what this AI assistant can do and also record the positive and negative of an AI assistant.</p>
<h1>SKILLS:</h1>

```
1.*how to use google*
2.*Creativity*
````

<p> The skill that i develop throughout this research is how to use google becaue i needed to find crediable source for this project. I needed a crediable source because it talks about real facts and show no biases. How to use google is very improtant for this project because i had to find sources that talk about future improvement and the current problems. Many people dont know how to use google and find crediable source which is hard to provide future techonlogy for the future. I searched up future problems+AI+business which gave me many sources that answer my problems. The problem it was able to answer for me was if AI techonlogy is really going to shift businesses. This problem was able to relate to the skill i learned because without the words i search up i would got many different bias point of view which would be hard to create future needs for. </p>
<p>The second skill i was able to develope was creativity because i needed to be creativity with the future techonlogy. I had to be both creative and general because i needed to know the general techonlogy for business inorder to find a creative verison of it. A creative idea that i thought off was if computers can fit in your pocket. I was able to get this idea because many business majors uses computer as a main source of notes and other things. But the negative thign about a computer is how big an d heavy it was. This led to me being creative if i can invent a computer that fits in your pocket so it can save spaxce in your backpack.</p>
