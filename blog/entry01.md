I choose business for this freedom project because I want to be able to start a business that i would be helpful to the community. I have seen a lot of business owners lose their business because they have financial challenges and I want to be able to expand my knowledge about business so i dont get myself into these kinds of problems. My back up idea was programming and 3D animation because they both were interesting and were something I would be interested in if business wasn't something I want to do in the future. The source https://www.deca.org/ which prepares young business major that has interest in marketing, finance, hospitality, and management. The skill i can learn from this website how to lead successfully by establishing goals, communication and teamwork, and problem solving. I can convey what i learned because this website is made by top education people in business which can help me under the different things that many people fail to learn in which their business crashes. Another source i used is https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/how-to-make-a-website-for-your-business/ teaches us how to make a website for your small business. The skill it can teach to me how to create a website for business and i would need to follow these steps to create a website and be globally known when expanding the business worldwide. i can convey what i learned with how-to-make-a-website-for-your-business because as i slowly grow interest in business i would need a website to sell my product.
