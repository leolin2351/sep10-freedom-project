# Entry 2
##### 11/4/24

<h1><b>Context:</b></h1>
<p>I was required to conduct research on business-related devices and hardware for this entry.  I was able to arrange my research the most efficiently. I began by looking for business devices and hardwares but the majority of these were just too common for business majors. After doing more research, I discovered https://www.lenovo.com/. This was the best I could manage because it included examples of business equipment, which is essential for those who are unfamiliar with it. I gained additional knowledge about business equipment and its possible benefits for me as a business major. I looked up business equipment online, but most of them were useless since they didn't provide any information on the products and how they can be applied. The website https://www.business.org was another resource I used since it provided business students with an explanation of the hardware. It included the four most crucial components for anyone planning to major in business. This describes the hardware and why it is necessary for the company, thus I think it's a useful source. The best source I found when looking for hardware for business majors was this one since it explained why, if I intended to major in business, I should purchase these items. To sum up, both of these websites are beneficial as I learned about the gear and gadgets used by business people.</p>

<p> I used an AI(Chat GPT) to generate 15 unknown devices and hardwares which I never knew existed because it wasn't common for business majors to use. These examples shocked me because I didn't know what an ergonomic keyboard, KVM Switches, and Cloud-Based Backup Drives were. For business students, Chat GTP was really beneficial because it taught me about 15 unknown devices and hardware pieces and explained their functions. I was also stuck on what important notes to take about devices and hardwares for business because I didn't want to use common devices and hardwares for business majors which a lot of people know about. I was able to learn more about business majors' devices and hardware because to Chat GTP.  </p>

<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>I conducted a lot of research on the skills I could gain from this, but one that I did learn was <b>how to Google</b> because I needed to conduct deep business research. Since I needed to find websites and sources that describe hardwares and devices, it taught me how to use trustworthy Google sites and sources. I looked up technology and devices for business majors, but the information wasn't very clear. I consequently looked for the best ways to explain hardware and devices and how business majors may use them. This search was beneficial since it allowed me to write about technology and technologies by providing clear explanations of them.This provided me with an opportunity to write about how it´s hardwares and devices may help business majors. Discovering deep information is made possible by this important skills that I am learning. </p>
<p> Another skill I learned from this study was <b>communication</b> because I had to communicate with my peers and teacher for ideas to know what I'm going to write about. I had to get ideas from people who are also doing business. The communication we did were sharing ideas of devices and hardwares to each other. We also helped each other with problems like if these sources and website were good enough for this blog. We had many arguments and agreement on ideas that we can use but some of us used the ideas we shared and others found better ideas we could use. This skill I conducted was important to me because I was able to share my hardwares and devices and get some feedback on the sources and websites I used.</p>
