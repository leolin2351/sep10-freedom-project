<h1><b>Context:</b></h1>
<p>In this entry, I was asked to research about the devices and hardwares connected to business.  I was able to some that best coordinate that what i am researching about. My first search were devices and hardwares for business but most of these devices and hardware were way to common for business majors. I had to deeper my researches and found https://www.lenovo.com/. This was the best i can do because it examples about business equipments which is important for people who have no knowledge about business equipments. I was able to learn more about business equipments and how they can benefit me if i was a business major. I searched up business devices but most of them werent useful because they didnt explain about devices and how they can be used. https://www.business.org/ was another source i used because it explained the hardwares for business majors. It gave the 4 most important hardwares if you were going to be a business major. I believe this is a good source because it explains the hardwares and why its needed for business. I searched up hardwares for business majors and this is the best source i used because it gave me a reason why i should buy these hardwares if i was going to start a business major. In conclusion both of these source are good because i was able to learn hardwares and devices that business people use.  </p>
